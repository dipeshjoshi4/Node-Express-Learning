### 2- History & Evolution

- JavaScript's Initial Role: Initially, JavaScript was only used for client-side tasks in web browsers.
- Creation of Node.js (2009): Ryan Dahl created Node.js by taking the V8 JavaScript engine (used in Google Chrome) and running it outside the browser.This innovation allowed JavaScript to handle server-side development

- Intoduction of Modules : nodejs came with built in  modules like http,which madeit popular for creating backend application

- npm (2010): Node.js launched its package manager (npm) in 2010, revolutionizing JavaScript development by simplifying package
 sharing and dependency management.

- io.js and Node.js Merger (2015): In 2015, Node.js merged with io.js, reuniting the ecosystem and bringing in 
community-driven improvements.

- Node.js Foundation (2015): The Node.js Foundation was established to support collaboration,
innovation, and sustainable development within the ecosystem

# Some Famous npm Packages

• Express.js: A popular framework for building web applications and APIs.
• Mongoose: A package for interacting with MongoDB databases using an object data modeling(ODM) approach
• Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
• React (and React-DOM): Though originally developed for the browser, React can be installed via npm for building morden web application
• Socket.IO: Enables real-time communication between clients and servers.
• Passport.js: Authentication middleware for Node.js.

# Merger of Node.js and io.js

What happened:

• io.js was a fork of Node.js created by developers who wanted faster updates and improvements. The merger brought io.js’s community-driven
innovations back into the main Node.js project

• The actual merger took place in September 2015, resulting in the release of Node.js v4.0. This version combined the best features of both projects, including V8 ES6 support from io.js and marked the beginning of a Long-Term-Support(LTS) release cycle for Node.js

• This ensured faster progress, stability, and a unified ecosystem for developers
