### 1. Introduction To Node JS

# What is NodeJS
- Open-Sorce ,serve-side,cross platform js runtime
- Allows you to run JS on your Machine or servers
- Built on the V8 Javascript engine for speed
- Robust ecosystem with 

* Open-source
- Any one can view modify and contribute

* crossplatform means operating system diff -diff(like MacOS,Windows,linux)

* Js runtime Environment refers to the environment where your JS code runs

* in Browser
- JS Typically runs in the browser(like chrome or firefox) to handle frontend tasks

* With Node.js
- node js allwos  js to run outside the browser  on the server
- it provides tool to interact with the system like:
- file system(read/write files)
- Network(handle HTTP requests)
- Database(connect to database like MongoDB or MySQL)

# Why Node.js special as runtime?
- V8 Engine
- Node.js uses Google Chrome's v8 engine to compile js into machine code making it lighting fast

- Built-in APIs :
- node js comes with Built in API so (like fs for  file system and http for servers).
- so you can build powerfull applications without extra libraries

# Why do we need  node.js?

## Single Language for full stack Development
- devlopers can use JS for both  frontend and backend reducing complexity
- for Example  a MERN  stack project(MongoDB,Express,React,Node)

## High Performance
- Thanks to V8 Engine Nodejs is superfast
- it can handle thousands of  simultanous connection with ease

## Event-Driven and Non-Blocking I/O
- Unlike traditional server that block a thread for each request,Node.js uses an asynchronous model, making it highly effiecient for handling multiple tasks.

## Scalable for Modern Application
- ideal for real-time application like chat apps,streaming platforms on online games

# is it Lnaguage or Framework ?
- Node.js is  not a programing language or a framework, but rather a js runtime environment that allows developers to run js ouside of a browser
